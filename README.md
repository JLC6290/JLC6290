### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer working on web applications, and always looking for new open source projects to contribute to. I React.js well to Node.js and Postgresql, and many associated libaries. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working my way through Mastering Bitcoin, a technical guide by Andreas Antonopolous
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently training to climb [Grand Teton!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Teton)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™ve just returned from a months-long climbing and mountain biking tour of the Pacific Northwest! Time to get back to the grind!

Connect with me here on github!
